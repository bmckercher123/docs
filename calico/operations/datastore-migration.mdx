| High Risk Images       | No                      | The number of images running in the namespace with High or Critical vulnerabilities, or have not been scanned. | Scanning images for known vulnerabilities is one of the most effective ways to prevent attackers from leveraging known exploits to gain access to systems and data. |
| Egress Access Security | Yes                     | The percentage of workloads that are communicating with endpoints external to the cluster that are not secured by network policy. | Implementing egress access controls helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized communication with malicious destinations, and helps prevent several phases of the [MITRE Attack Matrix](). |
| Namespace isolation    | Yes                     | The percentage of egress and ingress network traffic to/from namespaces that are not secured by network policy. | Isolating namespaces enforces multi-tenancy in your cluster to reduce the impact of potential issues. It also improves security to prevent several phases of the [MITRE Attack Matrix](). |
