# About Calico Enterprise cluster mesh

{{prodname}} cluster mesh provides federation capabilities to secure, observe communication, and troubleshoot workloads across multiple clusters.

## Value

{{prodname}} cluster mesh is for organizations who are building and deploying services across multiple clusters for high availability, disaster recovery, application isolation, compliance, and latency. Advantages include:

- Multi-cluster federation works across hybrid and multi-cloud
- Multi-cluster observability from the network to the application layer
- No need for an additional management plane
- Sidecar-less dataplane with Envoy as a DaemonSet
- WireGuard encryption
- {{prodname}} advanced tier and network policy engine

## Implementation

{{prodname}} cluster mesh implements and extends [Kubernetes multi-cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/). The following table summarizes the implementation and level of effort.

| For... | Cluster mesh uses... | Resources and tools | Requires configuration? |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Cross-cluster network connectivity | Multi-cluster networking | **Calico CNI** establishes pod IP routes across multiple clusters. | No |
| Cross-cluster endpoint sharing | Federated endpoints | A **kubconfig file** in each cluster provides authentication for endpoint sharing. | Yes |
|                          |                                             | The **RemoteClusterConfiguration** resource synchronizes all communication between clusters including: remote identity-aware policy, federated services, and multi-cluster networking. | Yes |
| Cross-cluster service discovery and sharing | Federated services | You create federated services and **Tigera Federated Service Controller** automaticaly monitors and maintains endpoint identity for each locally-federated service. | Yes |
| Cross-cluster visibility | Manager UI | Use **Service Graph** to see workload, network, and services connections. | No |
|                          |                    | Generate **policy recommendations** to quickly secure traffic from day one. | No |
|                          |                              | Use traffic **flow logs** to troubleshoot federated services. | No |
|                          |                            | Get alerts on threats in the **Service Events Management dashboards**. | No |
